/*
echo - statement is mainly used for debugging. The first use of echo is to 
output simple strings, also numbers and html. If we wanted to write on the 
webpage, we are better off using HTML tags to do so. The HTML will be added 
after the PHP code so donâ€™t forget the exit tag. 

print - similar to echo. It will print the string onto the page.

Use var_dump to get more info, like length and data type.
