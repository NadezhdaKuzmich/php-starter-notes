PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source 
general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and 
can be embedded into HTML. The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise 
questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are 
familiar with PHP. Hope, these exercises help you to improve your PHP coding skills. 
Currently, following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises. 
Happy Coding!This is the new content.
