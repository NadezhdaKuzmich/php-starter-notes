/*
- constructor -
A constructor is used to initialize member variables when an object 
is declared. It is automatically called at the time when the object 
of the class is declared.
Note: A constructor is a member function that is usually public.
Also keep in mind that unlike other methods defined inside a class, 
a constructor cannot return a value.

- destructors -
Destructors are the opposite of constructors, as they define the 
final behavior of an object and execute when the object is no longer 
in use. An objectâ€™s destructor, which takes no parameters, is called 
sometime after an object is no longer referenced, but the complexities 
of garbage collection make the specific timing of destructors uncertain.
Note: Destructors are not called but are invoked automatically.
